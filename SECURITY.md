# Security Policy

## Definition of a Vulnerability
We define a security vulnerability to be a weakness in a product, service, or software that could allow an attacker to comprimise the integrity, availability, or data of that product, service, or software.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
**Please do not report security vulnerabilities publically (e.g. through discord, creating a GitHub issue).**

If you believe that the security issue you have found is considered to be a vulnerability under our definition then please report it to us via github, or email us at **vulnerability@techstreet.tech**.
