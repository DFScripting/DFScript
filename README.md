## About
DFScript adds the ability to add new features through the added 
'scripting' ability. Scripting is constructing event based code (similar to DiamondFire) inside a client side menu, with the events and actions being simple client-based activities. 
For example,  a script could play a sound when the player receives a message with their name on it, or automatically add @ commands in front of sent messages.
___

To access the scripting menu, run ``/scripts``,  and a menu will appear showing all of the scripts you have installed. Here you can toggle, delete, edit and upload scripts.
*(A simple menu which can disable scripts can be accessed through the button in the top left.)* 

To install a script you can click 'Add' and browse through scripts that others have created, or select 'New Script' if you would like to create one yourself.

## Editing Scripts

To create a new script, run ``/script``, select 'Add', and 'New Script'. After naming your script, it will be created and displayed in the main menu. From here, you can edit, upload, delete, and toggle your script. 

Here is what each of these actions do:
- ![Edit icon](https://i.imgur.com/T01dmur.png) Edit: From this menu, you can add options and code to your script. 
- ![Upload icon]( https://i.imgur.com/0FuRXJ1.png) Upload: Uploads the script so that others with the mod can install and use it.
- ![Delete icon](https://i.imgur.com/Ya9xyWH.png) Delete: Deletes your script permanently.
- ![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/Av7lZmu.png)**/**![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/I8PXtvr.png) Toggle: Toggles your script on and off. When a script is off, it does not run at all. (Red means script is currently on, green means script is off.)
